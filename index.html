Near them, on the sand,\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\nThe hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\nMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.","title":"Ozymandias","author":"Percy Bysshe Shelley"},{"text":"so much depends\nupon\n\na red wheel\nbarrow\n\nglazed with rain\nwater\n\nbeside the white\nchickens","title":"The Red Wheelbarrow","author":"William Carlos Williams"},{"text":"I have eaten\nthe plums\nthat were in\nthe icebox\n\nand which\nyou were probably\nsaving\nfor breakfast\n\nForgive me\nthey were delicious\nso sweet\nand so cold","title":"This Is Just To Say","author":"William Carlos Williams"},{"text":"The apparition of these faces in the crowd:\nPetals on a wet, black bough.","title":"In a Station of the Metro","author":"Ezra Pound"},{"text":"Because I could not stop for Death—\nHe kindly stopped for me—\nThe Carriage held but just Ourselves—\nAnd Immortality.\n\nWe slowly drove—He knew no haste\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor and my leisure too,\nFor His Civility—\n\nWe passed the School, where Children strove\nAt Recess—in the Ring—\nWe passed the Fields of Gazing Grain—\nWe passed the Setting Sun—\n\nOr rather—He passed us—\nThe Dews drew quivering and chill—\nFor only Gossamer, my Gown—\nMy Tippet—only Tulle—\n\nWe paused before a House that seemed\nA Swelling of the Ground—\nThe Roof was scarcely visible—\nThe Cornice—in the Ground—\n\nSince then—'tis Centuries—and yet\nFeels shorter than the Day\nI first surmised the Horses' Heads\nWere toward Eternity—","title":"Because I could not stop for Death","author":"Emily Dickinson"},{"text":"Hope is the thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul,\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\nAnd never stops at all,\n\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little bird\nThat kept so many warm.\n\nI've heard it in the chillest land,\nAnd on the strangest sea;\nYet, never, in extremity,\nIt asked a crumb of me.","title":"Hope is the thing with feathers","author":"Emily Dickinson"},{"text":"I'm Nobody!

Auden"},{"text":"Quiet friend who has come so far,\n\nfeel how your breathing makes more space around you.\nLet this darkness be a bell tower\nand you the bell. As you ring,\n\nwhat batters you becomes your strength.\nMove back and forth into the change.\nWhat is it like, such intensity of pain?\nIf the drink is bitter, turn yourself to wine.\n\nIn this uncontainable night,\nbe the mystery at the crossroads of your senses,\nthe meaning discovered there.\n\nAnd if the world has ceased to hear you,\nsay to the silent earth: I flow.\nTo the rushing water, speak: I am.","title":"Let This Darkness Be a Bell Tower - Rainer Maria Rilke"},{"text":"You do not have to be good.\nYou do not have to walk on your knees\nfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.\nYou only have to let the soft animal of your body\nlove what it loves.\nTell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.\nMeanwhile the world goes on.\nMeanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain\nare moving across the landscapes,\nover the prairies and the deep trees,\nthe mountains and the rivers.\nMeanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,\nare heading home again.\nWhoever you are, no matter how lonely,\nthe world offers itself to your imagination,\ncalls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting—\nover and over announcing your place\nin the family of things.","title":"Wild Geese - Mary Oliver"},{"text":"Nature's first green is gold,\nHer hardest hue to hold,\n\nHer early leaf's a flower;\nBut only so an hour.\n\nThen leaf subsides to leaf.\nSo Eden sank to grief,\n\nSo dawn goes down to day.\nNothing gold can stay.","title":"Nothing Gold Can Stay - Robert Frost"},{"text":"Because I could not stop for Death,\nHe kindly stopped for me;\nThe carriage held but just ourselves\nAnd Immortality.\n\nWe slowly drove, he knew no haste,\nAnd I had put away\nMy labor, and my leisure too,\nFor his civility.\n\nWe passed the school where children played,\nTheir lessons scarcely done;\nWe passed the fields of gazing grain,\nWe passed the setting sun.\n\nWe paused before a house that seemed\nA swelling of the ground;\nThe roof was scarcely visible,\nThe cornice but a mound.\n\nSince then 't is centuries; but each\nFeels shorter than the day\nI first surmised the horses' heads\nWere toward eternity.","title":"Because I Could Not Stop For Death - Emily Dickinson"},{"text":"Some say the world will end in fire,\nSome say in ice.\nFrom what I’ve tasted of desire\nI hold with those who favor fire.\nBut if it had to perish twice,\nI think I know enough of hate\nTo say that for destruction ice\nIs also great\nAnd would suffice.","title":"Fire and Ice - Robert Frost"},{"text":"The world is too much with us; late and soon,\nGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—\nLittle we see in Nature that is ours;\nWe have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!\nThis Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;\nThe winds that will be howling at all hours,\nAnd are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;\nFor this, for everything, we are out of tune;\nIt moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be\nA Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;\nSo might I, standing on this pleasant lea,\nHave glimpses that would make me less forlorn;\nHave sight of Proteus rising from the sea;\nOr hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.","title":"The World is Too Much With Us - William Wordsworth"}];
